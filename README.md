## My process
1. I started by including all the elements necessary to build my HTML page.
2. I then proceeded to build my layout with the div element. I visualised it as putting boxes into boxes, therefor divs inside of divs.
3. Once my layout was finish I went to the styles.css to put together my elements and style them as I see fit, mainly using display as a grid and then aligning my items to the center. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Despite the difficulties I encountered, I did better my use of the div and how to center what is inside. 


### Continued development

I need to continue working on my display and how to center or move my elements around the page. Despite following tutorials, I can't seem to get it right and have to improvise.
